            <p>
              I am fascinated by <strong>technology</strong> and{" "}
              <strong>self-improvement.</strong> In college, I discovered
              authors like Steven Covey and David Allen. I realized I have every
              opportunity to optimize, refine, and redirect my efforts to
              produce the work and life that I most wanted. This website shares
              my personal and professional journey through life.
